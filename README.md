Jasmine - Learning to use Tests Effectively

What is it?
-----------

This project is about learning how to effectively use Jasmine to test code functionality without having to check everything manually.


Suites and 'It' Tests
---------------------

Within this app there are four 'Suites' describing what each set of tests is supposed to do. Within each Suite are a varying number of tests to check that functions are doing what they should. These tests are contained within 'it' functions that deal with specific aspects of the app. If one of the expectations (within the 'expect' functions) isn't met, then the test fails and shows up in red under the suite.

Installation
------------

You can download Jasmine at:

	[http://jasmine.github.io/];

This particular app uses Jasmine 2.1. The app itself can be forked at:

To Use
------

Load the page, and see if all tests don't come up green, go back and fix the test or the code until it passes the way you want it to.
